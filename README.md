# Libreddit

> An alternative private front-end to Reddit

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/QYbqTQt/libreddit-rust.png)

---

**10 second pitch:** Libreddit is a portmanteau of "libre" (meaning freedom) and "Reddit". It is a private front-end like [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) but for Reddit. Browse the coldest takes of [r/unpopularopinion](https://libreddit.spike.codes/r/unpopularopinion) without being [tracked](#reddit).

- üöÄ Fast: written in Rust for blazing-fast speeds and memory safety
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Light: no JavaScript, no ads, no tracking, no bloat
- üïµ Private: all requests are proxied through the server, including media
- üîí Secure: strong [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) prevents browser requests to Reddit

# About

Find Libreddit on üí¨ [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#libreddit:kde.org), üêã [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/libreddit/libreddit), :octocat: [GitHub](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit), and ü¶ä [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/libreddit/libreddit).

## Built with

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Programming language
- [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) - HTTP server and client
- [Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama) - Templating engine
- [Rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) - TLS library

## Info
Libreddit hopes to provide an easier way to browse Reddit, without the ads, trackers, and bloat. Libreddit was inspired by other alternative front-ends to popular services such as [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) for YouTube, [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) for Twitter, and [Bibliogram](https://sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram/) for Instagram.

Libreddit currently implements most of Reddit's (signed-out) functionalities but still lacks [a few features](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit/issues).

## How does it compare to Teddit?

Teddit is another awesome open source project designed to provide an alternative frontend to Reddit. There is no connection between the two and you're welcome to use whichever one you favor. Competition fosters innovation and Teddit's release has motivated me to build Libreddit into an even more polished product.

If you are looking to compare, the biggest differences I have noticed are:
- Libreddit is themed around Reddit's redesign whereas Teddit appears to stick much closer to Reddit's old design. This may suit some users better as design is always subjective.
- Libreddit is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) for speed and memory safety. It uses [Hyper](https://hyper.rs), a speedy and lightweight HTTP server/client implementation.

# Comparison

This section outlines how Libreddit compares to Reddit.

## Speed

Lasted tested Nov 11, 2022.

Results from Google PageSpeed Insights ([Libreddit Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Flibreddit.spike.codes%2F), [Reddit Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https://www.reddit.com)).

|                        | Libreddit   | Reddit    |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Requests               | 60          | 83        |
| Speed Index            | 2.0s        | 10.4s     |
| Time to Interactive    | **2.8s**    | **12.4s** |

## Privacy

### Reddit

**Logging:** According to Reddit's [privacy policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy), they "may [automatically] log information" including:
- IP address
- User-agent string
- Browser type
- Operating system
- Referral URLs
- Device information (e.g., device IDs)
- Device settings
- Pages visited
- Links clicked
- The requested URL
- Search terms

**Location:** The same privacy policy goes on to describe that location data may be collected through the use of:
- GPS (consensual)
- Bluetooth (consensual)
- Content associated with a location (consensual)
- Your IP Address

**Cookies:** Reddit's [cookie notice](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/cookies) documents the array of cookies used by Reddit including/regarding:
- Authentication
- Functionality
- Analytics and Performance
- Advertising
- Third-Party Cookies
- Third-Party Site

### Libreddit

For transparency, I hope to describe all the ways Libreddit handles user privacy.

#### Server

* **Logging:** In production (when running the binary, hosting with docker, or using the official instances), Libreddit logs nothing. When debugging (running from source without `--release`), Libreddit logs post IDs fetched to aid with troubleshooting.

* **Cookies:** Libreddit uses optional cookies to store any configured settings in [the settings menu](https://libreddit.spike.codes/settings). These are not cross-site cookies and the cookies hold no personal data.

#### Official instance (libreddit.spike.codes)

The official instance is hosted at https://libreddit.spike.codes.

* **Server:** The official instance runs a production binary, and thus logs nothing.

* **DNS:** The domain for the official instance uses Cloudflare as the DNS resolver. However, this site is not proxied through Cloudflare, and thus Cloudflare doesn't have access to user traffic.

* **Hosting:** The official instance is hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com/), which monitors usage to prevent abuse. I can understand if this invalidates certain users' threat models, and therefore, self-hosting, using unofficial instances, and browsing through Tor are welcomed.

You can also configure Libreddit with a configuration file. An example `libreddit.toml` can be found below:

```toml
LIBREDDIT_DEFAULT_WIDE = "on"
LIBREDDIT_DEFAULT_USE_HLS = "on"
```

### Examples

```bash
LIBREDDIT_DEFAULT_SHOW_NSFW=on libreddit
```

```bash
LIBREDDIT_DEFAULT_WIDE=on LIBREDDIT_DEFAULT_THEME=dark libreddit -r
```

## Proxying using NGINX

> **Note**
> If you're [proxying Libreddit through an NGINX Reverse Proxy](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit/issues/122#issuecomment-782226853), add
> ```nginx
> proxy_http_version 1.1;
> ```
> to your NGINX configuration file above your `proxy_pass` line.

## systemd

You can use the systemd service available in `contrib/libreddit.service`
(install it on `/etc/systemd/system/libreddit.service`).

That service can be optionally configured in terms of environment variables by
creating a file in `/etc/libreddit.conf`. Use the `contrib/libreddit.conf` as a
template. You can also add the `LIBREDDIT_DEFAULT__{X}` settings explained
above.

When "Proxying using NGINX" where the proxy is on the same machine, you should
guarantee nginx waits for this service to start. Edit
`/etc/systemd/system/libreddit.service.d/reverse-proxy.conf`:

```conf
[Unit]
Before=nginx.service
```

## Building

```
git clone https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit
cd libreddit
cargo run
```
